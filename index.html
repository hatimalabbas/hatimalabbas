<section id="advocacy" class="advocacy">
    <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-size: 40px;"><strong>Advocacy for Cord Blood</strong></h2>
    <div class="advocacy-text">
    <p>
        There’s a revolution in medicine - a quiet, powerful force that holds the promise to alter healthcare. At its core are
        cord blood stem cells, a resource so extraordinary that it demands our unwavering attention and support. These cells,
        rich with potential and ethically sourced, represent one of the most profound breakthroughs in transplantation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let’s consider the evidence. Since the first successful cord blood transplant in 1988, performed by the visionary Dr.
        Eliane Gluckman, over 40,000 transplants have been carried out globally. Today, cord blood stem cells are used to treat
        more than 80 diseases, including leukemias, lymphomas, and inherited metabolic and immune disorders. In some cases, cord
        blood has been the only viable option for patients who lack a fully matched bone marrow donor.
    </p>

    <p>
        These cells offer several distinct advantages:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Availability:</b> Cord blood is collected immediately after birth, a painless and ethical process that would otherwise go to waste. With a robust network of public and private banks, this resource can be harnessed efficiently.</li>
        <li><b>Flexibility:</b>  Unlike bone marrow, cord blood stem cells do not require a perfect HLA match, allowing broader donor-recipient compatibility. This has proven life-saving for patients from diverse ethnic backgrounds, who are often underrepresented in traditional donor registries.</li>
        <li><b>Reduced Complications:</b> Cord blood transplants carry a lower risk of graft-versus-host disease, a potentially fatal complication, even in mismatched transplants.
</li>
        <li><b>Innovation:</b> Advances in ex vivo expansion technology now allow scientists to multiply the number of stem cells in a single cord blood unit, making it viable for adult patients and significantly expanding its clinical applications.  </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Despite these groundbreaking advancements, umbilical cord blood stem cells continue to navigate a complex landscape.
        Some stakeholders, with a focus on traditional approaches, have expressed reservations about the broader adoption of cord
        blood, citing factors such as unit size. However, it is important to recognize the significant strides made in addressing
        these concerns, showcasing the immense potential of cord blood in advancing medical science and patient care.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the science doesn’t lie. Research into cord blood is not just thriving but accelerating. Clinical trials are
        exploring its use in cerebral palsy, autism, Type 1 diabetes, and even conditions like stroke and spinal cord injuries.
        Early results are promising, and the potential for life-changing treatments is enormous.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider this: every year, approximately 140 million babies are born worldwide, and each birth represents a unique
        opportunity to collect and preserve this invaluable resource. Yet, more than 98% of umbilical cords are discarded as
        medical waste. That is not just a loss - it is a heartbreaking misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
        The economics are compelling, too. A robust cord blood banking system could save billions of the strongest currencies in
        healthcare costs by reducing reliance on invasive procedures and long hospital stays. Furthermore, for nations
        investing in public health, cord blood stem cells provide an opportunity to create equitable, accessible therapies that
        bridge the gap for underrepresented communities.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is not about one approach versus another, nor is it about competing therapies like cord blood versus bone marrow or
        pharmaceuticals. It’s about developing a complementary and holistic framework for regenerative medicine that focuses on
        the best outcomes for patients. It’s important to understand that science and ethics must work together to create a
        future where every life is valued, and every patient has hope.
    </p>
    <p>
        The significance of this issue is too great for us to stay passive. We must advocate for continued investment in
        research, funding, and public awareness to ensure that the potential of umbilical cord blood stem cells is fully
        realized.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is not just another issue to debate. The science is clear, and the potential is there, yet we continue to see
        inaction. We cannot afford to let this opportunity slip away. There are lives at stake, and that’s a reality we can’t
        ignore. We are at a crossroads, and those who stand in the way of progress must be held accountable. This is not a time
        for hesitation or half-measures. We need to move past the talk and push for real, meaningful action. It’s time for all
        of us—scientists, policymakers, healthcare providers, and parents—to do what’s necessary to ensure this resource is put
        to use for the benefit of those who need it most. The future of healthcare won’t wait for us to be ready; we must act
        now to shape it with the tools we already have.
